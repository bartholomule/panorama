Debugging:
  In the new rt scene format, debugging can be enabled or disabled at will, by
  calling the debug() function, passing it 'on', 'off', 'true', 'false', 1, 0,
  or similar constructs that can be converted into boolean values. 
  ie. 
     debug(off); // Turns off debugging...
     ... // Perform non-debug initialization
     debug(on); // Turns on debugging...
     ... // Test something for debugging purposes.

RT:
  For comparisons, use '>.' instead of '>'.  This is so that the '>' symbol can
  be used for vectors (mostly for backwards compatibility).  If this becomes
  too cumbersome (which I don't forsee it being), the syntax for vectors can be
  replaced.
