  In this directory you will find information about the internals of the
 project. I know it's very limited, but I will be adding more info as I have
 time.

  If you need additional info on some topic, email me at ajimenez@vnet.es. I
 will answer the best I can, and may be add this info to this directory. So
 this is the way for you to tell me which parts of documentation do I have to
 extend.

  The little C++ style guide included has been used in sources of this project.
 All the sources in this project follow this rules, and I expect every code
 added to the main distribution to follow them too. If you send me code to add
 to the project, I will manually modify it to follow this rules, but it would
 be better if you use them yourself.

  Of course I'm not infallible, so there may be places in the sources where I
 didn't followed them, so tell me and I'll fix it. If you think these rules are
 wrong, or you want to add something, tell me about it.

  Finally, if you want to help with this project, read file 'PROJECTS' in this
 directory.
