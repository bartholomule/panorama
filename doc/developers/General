  The highest level structure is the scene (TScene). A scene is a collection of
 the elements needed to produce an image (TImage) of a given "world". This
 "world" is simply a set of geometrical objects (TObject) in a hierarchical
 structure. The scene also contains a camera definition (TCamera), a list of
 lights (TLight) and a renderer definition (TRenderer) that will be used to
 make this image.

  The element in charge of generating this final image is the renderer. It is
 independent of the rest of the elements, so that ray tracing, path tracing,
 radiosity, scanline, or any other rendering method implemented can be used
 with the same scene.

  Besides the geometrical definition, objects have other attributes that helps
 the renderer when calculating illumination. An object has a material
 (TMaterial), that define physical properties, like color, transparency,
 reflectivity, etc. An object can also have a list of object filters
 (TObjectFilter). These are applied to the color obtained during illumination
 calculation by the renderer.
 
  Once the whole image has been calculated, a postprocessing pass will apply a
 list of image filters (TImageFilter) to this image, if they are given. This
 filters can be used to get special effects on the whole image (fog,
 cartoon-like, etc). After that, image is saved to a file, in the format
 chosen.
