This is a list of things to be done for Panorama.

 If you have an idea for a new project, or you want to try one of the "not
started" project, please send mail to bug-panorama@gnu.org.

 Please report any errors from this page to bug-panorama@gnu.org.

-- General ----------------------------------------------------------

Project   : Statistics generator framework
Desc.     : A class for the generation of statistics.  ie. Ray-shape
            intersections/misses, Object construction counts, image load/saves,
            etc.  This could aid in debugging especially for bounding volume
            heirarchies.  
Status    : Not started

-- Plugin -----------------------------------------------------------

Project   : New plugin format
Desc.     : A new format (interface) for plugins, allowing more than one
            registered object per plugin file, plugin descriptions, version
            numbers, copyright strings, object dependency information, and more
            fun stuff to break binary compatibility. :) 
Status    : Not started

-- Paradigm ---------------------------------------------------------

Project   : Time
Desc.     : The addition of time, and its supporting constructs.  This should
            include time-changing matrices (for motion, transformation, etc),
            shutter speeds (camera), exposure levels for cameras (to allow
            images with proper/improper exposures, making possible changes to
            constrast, brightness, etc), time-varying textures/patterns (waves,
            fire, etc), and more.
Status    : Not started

Project   : Library separation
Desc.     : A separation of the current LLAPI/HLAPI libraries into multiple
            lower-level libraries, such as math, shapes, textures, and such.
            The reason for this is to allow the use of the sub libraries in
            other projects and lowering the overhead for using some of the
            features of the panorama library set.
Note      : This may require a good amount of rewrite.
Status    : Not started

-- Documentation ----------------------------------------------------

Project   : RT Scene documentation
Desc.     : Documentation is needed for the RT SDL, so that people may be able
            to create their own scenes without the need to read through
            everything that is included in the panorama package.
Status    : Not started

Project   : Plugin creation guide
Desc.     : Real documentation on how to write a plugin.  This will need to be
            delayed until the new plugin format is created. 
Status    : Not started

-- User interface ---------------------------------------------------

Project   : RT Scene modeler
Desc.     : A modeler for the RT scene language.  This may be broken up into
            sub projects, such as a GTK-- version, Windows (DirectX?) version,
            or similar.
Status    : Not started


-- BSDF -------------------------------------------------------------


-- CAMERA -----------------------------------------------------------

Project   : Simulation of a real camera model
Status    : Partially complete (thin-lens model of a camera), as of v0.18.  
            Still needs a major addition to panorama, the addition of time.
            Currently only shows focal blur (no object motion is possible).

Project   : Parallel projection camera
Status    : Working? In CVS repository (no examples exist).
Author(s) : Fausto Espinal


-- IMAGE FILTER -----------------------------------------------------

Project   : An image filter to write text into the image (maybe using
            freetype library)
Status    : In development
Author(s) : Ken Geis (kgeis@cchemnt.cchem.berkeley.edu)
