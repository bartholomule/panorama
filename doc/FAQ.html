revised the format for the file

----------------------------------------

Subject: <A NAME="3">3</A> General Questions.

Questions about what Panorama is, etc.

----------------------------------------

Subject: <A NAME="3.1">3.1</A> What is Panorama?

Panorama is a framework for 3D graphics production.
It is part of the GNU project.
This will include modeling, rendering, animating,
post-processing, etc. Currently, there is no
support for animation, but this will be added soon.

Functionally, it is structured as an API, composed
by two dynamic libraries, and several plugins, that
you can optionally load in runtime. A simple console
mode front-end for this API is included in the package,
that can load a scene description in one of the supported
scene languages, and then outputs a single image file
in any of the supported graphic formats.

----------------------------------------

Subject: <A NAME="3.2">3.2</A> Is Panorama a renderer?

Yes, but it is more than a renderer. It is a general framework for
3D graphics production. This includes rendering, procedural
modeling and animation, postprocesing, etc. See
README file for more information in current status.

----------------------------------------

Subject: <A NAME="3.3">3.3</A> Is Panorama a raytracer?

It can do raytracing (see next question), but it is not simply
a raytracer or renderer (see previous question).

----------------------------------------

Subject: <A NAME="3.4">3.4</A> Is Panorama compatible with POVRay?

It can do raytracing. When the POV scene plugin is finished, it will be
able to load POVRay scenes and render them. But not only that. It will be
able to render this scene with any of its renderers.

----------------------------------------

Subject: <A NAME="3.5">3.5</A> Does it have a modeler?

A graphic interface has been started, but it does not currently include a
modelling tool.  It does, however, have an object
oriented scene description language. This allowing objects
or material types to inherit properties from other
such objects, and it includes the idea of aggregate
objects to handle collections as a single unit.

----------------------------------------

Subject: <A NAME="3.6">3.6</A> Who wrote Panorama?

----------------------------------------

Subject: <A NAME="3.7">3.7</A> Can I distribute it?

Yes. Panorama has been put under GPL license.
See:

----------------------------------------

Subject: <A NAME="3.8">3.8</A> Can I help ?

Of course. Take a look at the developers page:

----------------------------------------

Subject: <A NAME="3.9">3.9</A> Does Panorama have a homepage?

Yes, on the Gnu site.

----------------------------------------

Subject: <A NAME="3.10">3.10</A> What Panorama mailing lists/newsgroups are there?

There are no newsgroups.  There are the following
mailing lists:
<A HREF="mailto:bug-panorama@gnu.org">bug-panorama@gnu.org</A> to send bug reports and fixes. 
<A HREF="mailto:help-panorama@gnu.org">help-panorama@gnu.org</A> for user discussion of the program.
<A HREF="mailto:devel-panorama@gnu.org">devel-panorama@gnu.org</A> for discussion among developers.

To subscribe, send a message to 
    <A HREF="mailto:bug-panorama-request@gnu.org">bug-panorama-request@gnu.org</A>

with the word 'subscribe' in the subject.

----------------------------------------

Subject: <A NAME="3.11">3.11</A> What plans do you have for the future?

 A010: We just want to make this the best environment for
       modeling, rendering and animation. More info about
       what we are doing now in the development page:
       <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/panorama/development.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/panorama/development.html</A>

----------------------------------------

Subject: <A NAME="4">4</A> Questions about building Panorama

----------------------------------------

Subject: <A NAME="4.1">4.1</A> What is the latest version?

0.13.3
----------------------------------------

Subject: <A NAME="4.2">4.2</A> Where can I get it?

<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/panorama/download.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/panorama/download.html</A>
has pointers to:
<A HREF="ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/panorama-0.13.3.tar.gz">ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/panorama-0.13.3.tar.gz</A>
<A HREF="http://www.vnet.es/~ajimenez/panorama-0.13.3.tar.gz">http://www.vnet.es/~ajimenez/panorama-0.13.3.tar.gz</A>
and other places.

----------------------------------------

Subject: <A NAME="4.3">4.3</A> Will it ever build under GNU C++ 2.7.2.X?

No. Panorama makes extensive use of STL classes, and there are many
problems in GNU C++ 2.7.2 STL implementation, and with templates in
general.

----------------------------------------

Subject: <A NAME="4.4">4.4</A> I have had problems building under Solaris 2.5.1. 
             What should I look out for?

If you are using egcs-1.1.2 or later, make sure
your LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not pointing at the 
Sun Workshop libraries.  And Vice Versa.

----------------------------------------

Subject: <A NAME="4.5">4.5</A> I have successfully built Panorama, how do I 
             run a make check to be sure things are sane.

You cannot do this at this time. Running
programs/render/render directly is likely to
result in an error about not finding some 
library file.

----------------------------------------

Subject: <A NAME="4.6">4.6</A> I have successfully installed Panorama, but render
             complains about not seeing libllapi.so.0

Make sure that the lib directory you have just
installed is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH

----------------------------------------

Subject: <A NAME="4.7">4.7</A> What executables exist after the build?

Only render.  Prior to installation this is
to be found in programs/render/render.
On Solaris it will be installed in 
/opt/panorama/bin/render .

----------------------------------------

Subject: <A NAME="5">5</A> Questions about the Scene Language

----------------------------------------

Subject: <A NAME="5.1">5.1</A>: Where can I find a grammar for the Scene Language
 
There is a Bison grammar in the distribution at:
plugins/scene_io/rt/parser.y
