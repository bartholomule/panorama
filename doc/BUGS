[_OBJECTS_]

 - Triangle/rectangle intersection has some precision problems.

 - There are problems with transformations of aggregates including spheres.

 - Cone fails for min_radius == 0 and for min_radius == max_radius.

 - Cylinders are located improperly after translating (such as in a CSG 
   object), or when initialize is called multiple times.  There must be an
   improper scaling factor, because as a CSG or Aggregate containing a cylinder
   is moved, the cylinder is moved at a more rapid rate (it seperates itself
   from the CSG or Aggregate).

 - Planes and its subclasses (circle, rectangle, triangle) seem to fail now
   that the coordinate references have been globally changed.  This shouldn't
   be that hard to fix. 

[_SCENES_]

 - Some material scenes do not render correctly.

[_SCENE_LOADERS_]

 - The RT scene loader [parser] has some form of bug which causes segmentation
   faults on when loading scenes containing some forms of materials: bump,
   brick, crackle, leopard, marble.  Other materials appear to work fine.

[_PROGRAMS_]

 - The gui (panorama) has many known problems:
    * Attempting to change properties of the renderer will fail after changing
      properties of the scene (incorrect copying of attributes). 
    * Error output is sent to stdout, instead of being displayed in a box.
    * Failure to load a plugin will result in termination of the program, even
      if that plugin is not used (bug in the TPluginManager class).
    * Preview mode on rendering does not give enough options about the quality
      of the preview.  It is either lousy (1/16th to 1/2 the time on average of
      the full render), or just a full render--It is missing options.
    * Attempting to change any of the properties of any class which contains an
      attribute of type FX_IMAGE, FX_CAMERA, FX_BSDF, etc., will usually result
      in the program crashing (similar bug to that of changing the renderer
      after changing the scene.
    * There does not exist a material editor.
 
[_GUI_]

 - Only one scene may be loaded for each execution of 'panorama'.
 - Choices are not enumerated (fix on the way with new attributes).
