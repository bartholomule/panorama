[_OBJECTS_]

 - Triangle/rectangle intersection has some precision problems.

 - There are problems with transformations of aggregates including spheres.

 - Cone fails for min_radius == 0 and for min_radius == max_radius.

 - Cylinders are located improperly after translating (such as in a CSG 
   object), or when initialize is called multiple times.  There must be an
   improper scaling factor, because as a CSG or Aggregate containing a cylinder
   is moved, the cylinder is moved at a more rapid rate (it seperates itself
   from the CSG or Aggregate).

 - Planes and its subclasses (circle, rectangle, triangle) seem to fail now
   that the coordinate references have been globally changed.  This shouldn't
   be that hard to fix. 

 - Making copies of aggregates and then moving (or modifying) them will now
   modify the original and *all* other copies.  The desired behavior should be
   to make a copy, instead of sharing the pointer.  See
   scenes/misc/lamp_point.rt for an example of how this is happening (there
   should be TWO lamps in the output image).

[_SCENES_]

 - Some material scenes do not render correctly.

[_SCENE_LOADERS_]

 - The RT scene loader [parser] has some form of bug which causes segmentation
   faults on when loading scenes containing some forms of materials: bump,
   brick, crackle, leopard, marble.  Other materials appear to work fine.

[_PROGRAMS_]

 - The gui (panorama) has many known problems:
    * Attempting to change properties of the renderer will fail after changing
      properties of the scene (incorrect copying of attributes). 
    * Error output is sent to stdout, instead of being displayed in a box.
    * Failure to load a plugin will result in termination of the program, even
      if that plugin is not used (bug in the TPluginManager class).
    * Preview mode on rendering does not give enough options about the quality
      of the preview.  It is either lousy (1/16th to 1/2 the time on average of
      the full render), or just a full render--It is missing options.
    * Attempting to change any of the properties of any class which contains an
      attribute of type FX_IMAGE, FX_CAMERA, FX_BSDF, etc., will usually result
      in the program crashing (similar bug to that of changing the renderer
      after changing the scene.
    * There does not exist a material editor.
 
[_GUI_]

 - Only one scene may be loaded for each execution of 'panorama'.
 - Choices are not enumerated (fix on the way with new attributes).

[_SYSTEM_]
 - The new RT scene language requires bison-1.875 (modified) to compile.  The
   problem is that in bison-1.875, lalr1.cc had a typo or improperly left-in
   underscore on two of the lines.  The fix is (if you can write to your bison
   config files) to change the two lines in lalr1.cc (usually in
   /usr/share/bison) starting at line 142 where it says:
   Current.last_line = Rhs[N].last_line; \   
   Current.last_column = Rhs[N].last_column;

   To read as follows:
   Current.last.line = Rhs[N].last.line; \   
   Current.last.column = Rhs[N].last.column;

   All that is, is replacing the underscore ('_') with a dot ('.').

   With this fix done, it will compile properly.  If you don't have access to
   these files or don't know what is going on, don't mess with any parsers from
   this project.  The parser will come with a pre-defined parser.cpp and its
   supporting headers, if no modifications are made to the parser then these
   will work fine.
