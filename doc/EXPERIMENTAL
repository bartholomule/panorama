 Code which is still labeled "experimental" (i.e. you have to use the
'--enable-experimental' switch in configure to include that code in the
compilation):

 plugins/object/abvh           Automatic Bounding Volume Hierarchy
 plugins/object/height_field   Height field
 plugins/object/lwo            LightWave object
 plugins/object/polyhedron     Polyhedron object
 plugins/renderer/zbuffer      ZBuffer renderer
 plugins/scene_io/psl          Procedural scene language

 You will have to add them to your pluginrc file, in order to load them.

 Notes:
 ------
 
 * You will have to remove rt_io.plg from your pluginrc if you want to test
 psl, i.e. only one of them can be loaded at any time. This will be fixed in
 future releases.
