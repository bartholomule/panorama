 To install this program, type:

 $ tar xvfz panorama-X.X.X.tar.gz

   Unpacks sources.

 $ cd panorama-X.X.X

   Enter project directory.
 
 $ ./configure [--prefix=<project_directory>] [--enable-static-link]
   [--enable-debug]

   This generates all makefiles, setting project main directory to
  <project_directory>. If you don't specify this parameter, it will default to
  /opt/panorama.

   If '--enable-static-link' option is given, all the source files in the
  project will be compiled with profiling information, and they will all be
  statically linked, including plugins.

   If '--enable-debug' option is given, all the source files will be compiled
  with debug information for GNU debugger (gdb). This option can be used with
  dynamic or static linking.

 $ make

   Builds the project.

 $ make install

   Create directories (if they don't exist) and copy files onto them. If you
  are installing onto /opt/panorama, you will need to be root.

 $ mkdir ~/.panorama && cp doc/pluginrc ~/.panorama     (Optional)

   Creates a local config directory in user directory. This is recomended if
  you want to change something in the plugin configuration file (pluginrc).

  Before running the program, you will also have to add Panorama library
 directory to the library path:

 $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/panorama/lib

 (substitute /opt/panorama with the right directory).
 

 Notes:
 ------

 * If you are using GNU C++ compiler, you need version 2.8.1 or newer and
 libstdc++ 2.8.1 or newer to build this project. It will not build under GNU
 C++ 2.7.2 (read the FAQ).
 
 * If you are using GNU libc 2, you may have problems during program execution,
 when trying to open plugin files. This is because of a bug in glibc's dynamic
 linking code, fixed in 2.0.7. (If you are using RedHat distribution, you must
 have glibc-2.0.7-6 RPM or newer).
