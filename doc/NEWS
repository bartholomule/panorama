>> Version 0.18.01 released (11 Feb 2003)
 - Fixed problems which prevented 0.18 from compiling.

 - Added libtool support (now required).

 - Added another abstraction above the class manager, to allow a more complete
   separation of the llapi and hlapi libraries. NOTE: This still needs work.

>> Version 0.18 released (21 November 2002)

 - Windows (MSVC++6) project files added, for a statically linked 'render'
   executable, TGA image only (done by Kevin Harris). No windows gui exists 
   (yet).

 - Fixed some problems with the RT SDL, and added some new features to it.

 - Fixed problem with static linking and profile info.

 - Functions added for root solving (generic, and specific).

 - Area lights added.  
   This added the ability to have any object of any shape be an area light.

 - Added Dependency file creation: make deps

 - Initialize() returns bool.  
   Checking of the 'initialize' function will be possible to detect problems,
   and potentially quit before those problems become HUGE, and possibly eat up
   all your memory, or core dump.

 - GTK-- GUI added.  
   This is Angel's GUI, but fixed to work with newer GTK-- versions, and with
   newer additions to panorama (still not complete, and buggy, due to current
   panorama limitations).

 - TIFF images are now supported, if libtiff is installed.

 - Freetype library compatibly fix added for newer freetype.
   Version 2 is now supported.

 - Thin-lens camera added.  
   This allows focal blur, for some interesting and increasingly realistic
   images. 

 - Parallel-projection camera added.  
   This could allow the generation of the 'impossible triangle' and other such
   optical illusions, as well as non-distorted (in perspective) images for use
   in range-data or height field image creation. 

 - Perturbations added. 
   Normal Perturbations were added to enhance/simplify texture creation (see
   patterns). 

 - Patterns added. 
   Constant values in textures were replaced by patterns.  This allows nice
   texture mapping, bump mapping, etc. based on patterns or images.

 - Some parser bugs corrected.

 - More scene files.

 - Other portability bug fixes.
