 OBJECTS

 MATERIALS
 
 - 2D textures (with different mapping methods).
 - Mappings for 3D textures.

 LIGHTS
 
 - Extended (area, linear, volume) lights for raytracing.

 SCENE LANGUAGE
 
 - The new procedural scene language/engine (animation would be good, but not
 necessary for 1.0).

 RENDERERS
 
 - ZBuffer renderer (not sure about this one; it implies several other
 features).

 GENERAL
 
 - No (or very little) "experimental" code.
