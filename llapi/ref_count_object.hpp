/*
  Revision History:
  02Jan2000 Created this file, wrote the reference_counting_object class
  14Feb2000 Changed the class to be templated on the counting type (ie. int,
  long, short, char, etc.), changed all of the printf statements to
  only occur when KH_DEBUG_RCO is defined.
  01Mar2003 Changed/added comments to work with both doc++ and ccdoc.
