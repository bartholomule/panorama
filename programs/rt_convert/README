This is a work in progress.  That means it doesn't work yet.

It will, eventually, be a converter from the old RT format to the new one.
That is, if I can keep up the motivation to work on it, as I don't really care 
about the old format. 

It may be more useful to abandon this and start work on a converter for POV
format files.  We'll see what happens.
